# MySQL vs PostgreSQL Setup on AWS RDS

## 1. Key Differences Observed

- **MySQL**

  - Simpler setup with fewer parameters to tweak.
  - Works well for basic read-heavy workloads.
  - Common tools: MySQL Workbench, phpMyAdmin.
  - Replication options: Single-AZ, Multi-AZ, Read Replicas (simpler setup).

- **PostgreSQL**
  - More tunable parameters; slightly more complex setup.
  - Excels at complex queries, analytics, and handling concurrency.
  - Common tools: pgAdmin, DBeaver.
  - Replication options: Single-AZ, Multi-AZ, Read Replicas (supports logical & streaming replication).

**Takeaway:**  
MySQL is great for straightforward workloads, while PostgreSQL provides more advanced features for complex applications.

## 2. Instance Availability Times

- **MySQL:** ~5–7 minutes
- **PostgreSQL:** ~7–10 minutes

> Observation: PostgreSQL takes slightly longer due to extra initialization and background processes.

## 3. Effect of Choosing a Larger Instance Class

- Faster instance initialization (slightly).
- Better performance: higher CPU, memory, and IOPS handling.
- Higher cost.
- Supports larger storage and throughput.
- Failover (Multi-AZ) may be marginally faster.

**Tip:** For testing or learning, smaller instances (e.g., `t3.medium`) are sufficient. For production, choose based on workload requirements.

## 4. Personal Notes / Lab Insights

- PostgreSQL setup felt more detailed but gives more flexibility.
- MySQL setup was quick and easy—perfect for simple apps.
- Choosing the instance class matters more for production workloads than lab exercises.
- Multi-AZ adds reliability but increases setup time slightly.
